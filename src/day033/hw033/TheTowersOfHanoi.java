     * The Towers of Hanoi - one of possible  solution
     * The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower[1] and sometimes pluralized as Towers)
     * is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes,
     * which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size
     * on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.
     * *
     * The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
     * *
     * - Only one disk can be moved at a time.
     * - No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
     * - Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack
     * or on an empty rod.
     * *
     * With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve
     * a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^n – 1, where n is the number of disks.
     * For example, a stack of 20 disks will require 2^20 – 1 moves;
